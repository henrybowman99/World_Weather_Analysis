# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a pandas dataframe of random cities throughout the world. The dataframe was populated with weather data, which I gathered using the Open Weather API key. I exported this dataframe as a CSV and then created several figures with this data using Google Maps API. The first figure is a map with markers for every city fitting the temperature requirements inputed by the user. The last two figures display directions between four selected cities and their respective markers. I utilized Python with pandas, numpy, citipy, and gmaps dependencies along with the APIs discussed above to complete my analysis.
